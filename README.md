Student Exam Dataset Analysis in Python
ğŸ“Š Insights and Visualizations
I'm excited to share my latest project where I analyzed a comprehensive student exam dataset using Python. This analysis explored various factors influencing students' performance and examined the interactions between these factors.
ğŸ”¸ Problem Statements:
What factors (features) affect test scores most?
Are there interacting features which affect test scores?

ğŸ”¸Key Processes:

ğŸ”¸Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, categorizing data.

ğŸ”¸Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis and visualization to understand data distribution and relationships.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
ğŸ”¸Data Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to identify trends and patterns.

ğŸ”¸Handling Missing Data: Filling NaN values with appropriate strategies.

ğŸ”¸Statistical Analysis: Identifying significant features and interactions.

 ğŸ”¸ Findings and Insights:
The impact of parental education, study habits, and other factors on test scores.
Significant interactions between features affecting student performance.
